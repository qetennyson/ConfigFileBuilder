# ConfigFileBuilder
An open source version of the configuration file builder I made.  You can use this to mass produce configuration files for anything with an INI or DAT format.

This is the first Python program I ever wrote to do something useful.  It is terrible.

I'm not updating it, because it's an exercise in humility to look at it now :)
